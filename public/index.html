    <h4>More Books</h4>

    <p>The popular kids. In my observation, most experienced programmers will have either glanced at them or know them
      well and their influence. Unfortunately these titles can be voluminous, borish academic tomes. What's more, there's scant
      counsel (if any) for how to read them successfully. However, if you can get situated, their lessons are readily
      applicable to everyday practice you'll find yourself nodding along or exclaiming excitedly, "ohhhh, that's why
      [old so and so] suggested that in my PR"; or "ohhhh, that's why my manager talks about [xyz] all the time."</p>
    <p> The best I can advise is to start browsing from the TOC or index by topic or keyword, pick a point of entry,
      then go. Or try the Benjamin Franklin method (as <a
        href="https://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-benjamin-franklin-method-of-reading.html">explained</a> by James
      Koppel). In fact, today this type of reconstruction exercise is generally understood by cognitive scientists as an
      important strategy for memory retention, called <em>elaboration</em>: "thinking about what you want to remember,
      relating it to existing memories, and making the new memories fit into schemata already stored in your LTM." (p44,
      <em>The Programmer's Brain)</em></p>
